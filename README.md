# Staff / Customer Management System:

#### Final project for my Cloud Development Course at Oregon State University

Setting : 
" A high end Japanese restaurant that features multiple private dining rooms. Rooms can only be used by esteemed members. 
Each staff member is responsible for handling the member that they have assigned a room to. Staff A may not alter Staff B's booking"

##### Technologies :
+ JWT Tokens: 
Upon staff login, they are then assigned a token. Tokens are verified before they can make changes or edits.
+ Datastore:
Uses Google Datastore for storing models 
+ PostMan:
Tests all REST apis via PostMan
